Day 35
===============================================================================

Today I made rain alert SMS app using python where it would check if it was going to rain in my city from [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and send a SMS to my number to tell me to bring an umbrella using the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python).
