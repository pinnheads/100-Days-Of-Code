Day 46
===============================================================================

Today I created a spotify playlist maker of top 100 songs from the billboard
list using web scraping, OAuth etc.

Basically it will get the list of Top 100 songs on a specified date and then search for those songs on spotify and create a playlist for all the found songs.
