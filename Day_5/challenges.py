# Challenge 1
# Average Height
# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.
# Example Input

# 156 178 165 171 187

# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: 156, 178, 165, 171, 187
# Example Output

# 171
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])

total = 0
for student_height in student_heights:
    total += student_height

avg_height = total/len(student_heights)
print(round(avg_height))

# Challenge 2
# Highest Score
# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

#     The highest score in the class is: x

# Example Input

# 78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89

# In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# Example Output

# The highest score in the class is: 91
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)

max = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > max:
        max = score
    else: 
        continue

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {max}")

# Challenge 3
# Adding Evens
# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.
total = 0
for number in range(0, 101, 2):
    print(number)
    total += number
print(total)

# Challenge 3
# FizzBuzz
# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

#     Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

#     When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

#     `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 

#       `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

# e.g. it might start off like this:

# `1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz`
for number in range(1, 101):
	if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
		print("FizzBuzz")
	elif number % 5 == 0:
		print("Buzz")
	elif number % 3 == 0:
		print("Fizz")
	else:
		print(number)
